## User Experience

As each user logs in they will be designated as either "User 1" or "User 2." Once both have logged in the "User 1" will be prompted to select his/her tool. Then "User 2" will be prompted to choose his/her tool. After this happens the result of the game will be shown and the wins/losses recorded.
